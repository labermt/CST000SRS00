Unresolved Issues:

Step 3) Cannot figure out how to do a pull request from my fork into the main fork as requested.
		No changes have been made yet. There is nothing to have pulled into the main repo.

Step 10) This is unclear. The pushed changes are availabled on my repository. My pushed changes have not been pulled into the main repository.
		Should I be pulling into the main repository or not?
		Should I have branced from my repository and then pulled back into master?

Notes:
Uncommented the hellow world line
